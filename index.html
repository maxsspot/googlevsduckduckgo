        <h2>WHAT ARE GOOGLE AND DUCKDUCKGO?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Google and DuckDuckGo are both things called <a href = "https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/search%20engine" target = "_blank">search engines</a>. Google and DuckDuckGo are used to crawl the web and to find information for you based off of your search.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Today, you will learn the difference between these two search engines and which one might be better for you.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES OF GOOGLE</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Google is one of the largest and most popular search engines on the web right now. Dissapointingly, they also <a href "https://www.avg.com/en/signal/how-google-uses-data " target = "_blank">collect a lot of your data</a>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For some people, this stands to be a huge issue. For others, it's not much of a problem.</p>
        <br>
        <p>One more poor aspect of Google is their <a href = "https://securityheaders.com/?q=google.com&followRedirects=on" target = "_blank">website security</a> is poor.</p>
        <br>
        <p>A positive aspect of Google is that their results usually match exactly what you need.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So if privacy and security is not of your concern, Google would be a great choice for being your search engine.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES OF DUCKDUCKGO</h2>
        <br>
        <p>DuckDuckGo is a popular search engine, but it's nowhere near the level of popularity that Google is at.</p>
        <br>
        <p>One of the main ideas that DuckDuckGo prides themselves on is the <a href = "https://duckduckgo.com/privacy" target = "_blank">privacy</a> and <a href = "https://securityheaders.com/?q=duckduckgo.com&followRedirects=on">security</a> of their search engine.</p>
        <br>
        <p>DuckDuckGo gets their search results from Bing. So essentialy, you are searching Bing, but privatley and securely.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you are interested in a more private and secure search engine, DuckDuckGo would be great for you!</p>
        <br>
        <h2>THE VERDICT</h2>
        <br>
        <p>For those who are ok with giving up some privacy and security for good results, <b>Google</b> would be the search engine for you. <br><br>For those who are ok with slightly different results but with added privacy and security, pick <b>DuckDuckGo</b>!</p>
